# Current Development

Mutable Realms develops one idea at a time. This document tracks the single active idea and the recently closed trail. It is not a backlog: ideas that are interesting but not being worked on belong in the [readme.md](../readme.md) *Roadmap*; finished ideas are recorded in [maintenance-guide.md](maintenance-guide.md) under *Development history*.

## Active idea

### Current-location local maps after narrated movement — in progress

**Goal:** make every playable scenario show a map of the player's current location rather than a world-wide fallback or a stale previous scope. When the player moves from Main Street to Market Row, the map should discard the previous visible nodes, show Market Row as the player location, show Main Street as an exit when the persisted movement graph supports it, and show up to 100 direct child locations of Market Row. The same rule must work for tropical beaches, roads, settlements, interiors, and other scenario geography without Aerthalon-specific assumptions.

**Scope:**

- Resolve the default map scope from the authoritative player's current location on every map read; do not retain the previous location's `is_default_scope` as the active player view.
- Render only child and sibling location nodes inside the scoped map; the current location remains authoritative scope metadata for the title but is not rendered as a map node.
- Do not highlight the current player location in the map; the map title communicates where the player is.
- Render up to 100 direct child locations belonging to the current scope, plus bounded sibling locations that share the current location's parent; root-level locations with no parent are treated as virtual-world siblings.
- Mark sibling locations as presentation neighbors, not child locations or inferred movement destinations.
- Expose neighboring/previous locations as boundary exits when explicit persisted links leave the current scope; exits are orientation/travel hints, not UI travel controls.
- Keep map state derived from SQLite after movement so a successful narrated move immediately changes the map's working set.
- Preserve flat-world compatibility and explicit scope navigation for administrative/read-only map browsing.
- Keep child-location and sibling-location accessibility narrator-driven; this slice does not infer new travel permissions from containment.

**Out of scope:**

- Aerthalon-specific names, automatic roads, travel-time simulation, route generation, fast travel, or UI-driven movement.
- Removing `location_links` or changing the existing movement precondition.
- Cardinal-direction metadata and arrows; those remain a later presentation slice once current-location scoping is correct.

**Verification:** pending this presentation refinement. The current location remains in the backend response as scope metadata, while the frontend must render only children/neighbors and no player highlight. Required evidence is a rebuilt frontend, a Main Street map DOM check with no Main Street node/ring, and regression coverage preserving child and sibling nodes.

**Route verification:** `243` backend tests pass; `npm run lint` passes Ruff and TypeScript; `npm run frontend-build` passes; and a temporary server on port 8795 accepted route creation at revision `0 → 1`, traveled the player from `harbor` to `city` at `1 → 2` without a `location_links` row, and replayed the same travel operation with `already_applied: true` without another revision. SQLite readback confirmed `world_route_set`, `entity_route_traveled`, the route endpoints, and final player placement; port 8795 was stopped and confirmed closed.

**Expansion verification:** `248` backend tests pass; `npm run lint` passes Ruff and TypeScript; `npm run frontend-build` passes; and a temporary server on port 8795 accepted a structured `market` proposal at revision `0 → 1`, created its `city` containment and `harbor` physical link, replayed the proposal without another revision, and rejected a duplicate name with HTTP `409`. SQLite readback confirmed `location_expanded`, the proposal ledger, final location data, containment, link, and world revision; port 8795 was stopped and confirmed closed.

**Contextual-start verification:** `252` backend tests pass; `npm run lint` passes Ruff and TypeScript; `npm run frontend-build` passes; and a temporary server on port 8795 started an Aerthalon-like world at **Main Street** with the Adventurer's Guild as a child location and an explicit local link. The world revision advanced `1 → 2`; SQLite readback confirmed the narration was stored in the same operation result, and exact replay returned the identical response without another revision. Same-world name collisions are rejected rather than silently duplicated; port 8795 was stopped and confirmed closed. An independent review found and the implementation fixed a separate-transaction replay hazard before closeout.

**Scoped-map polish verification:** `256` backend tests pass; `npm run lint` passes Ruff and TypeScript; `npm run frontend-build` passes; and `git diff --check` passes. Temporary HTTP verification served the rebuilt frontend and confirmed the scoped map API continued returning boundary exits; the user then manually verified the Aerthalon map after pushing `78a8875`. The temporary server was stopped and port 8795 was confirmed closed. The backend map contract and authoritative movement data were unchanged.

## How an idea becomes work

1. **User describes the idea in prose** — no format required.
2. **Restate as a scoped slice** — goal, what changes, what is out of scope, how to verify. Follow the vertical-slice pattern in the maintenance guide (migration → operation → context → validation → agent surface → turn policy → docs → tests) unless the idea is presentation-only.
3. **Record the scope here** (status: scoped / in progress) before implementing.
4. **Implement and verify** — full suite, lint, and live verification proportional to risk.
5. **Flip status to complete** with verification evidence and a suggested branch + commit message; the user commits and pushes.
6. **Close the entry.** If the idea is postponed mid-way, move it as one line into the readme *Roadmap* and mark it abandoned here.

Notes on the process, learned during the plan era and still enforced:

- One supported mutation per narrated turn; authoritative state is SQLite; narration and visualization are derived views.
- Never claim a capability works without real verification output (tests + live evidence).
- Keep the tracker small: one active idea, a short closed trail, no backlog accumulation.
